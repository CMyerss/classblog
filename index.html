        <ul>
            <li><h3>Summary</h3></li>
            <ul>
                <li><p>I first wanted to start off with a basic article about everything simple on HTML.
                    I personally have never worked on anything HTML before, and I knew Geeks for Geeks is a 
                    great website to get started, so, here we are! The first thing that I found to be very important
                    is the body tags. In the Labs my partner and I had been getting away without them, but now I see
                    due to simple grouping and it's important so that when we get to complex topics, we can be aware
                    of what we want to show. 
                </p></li>
                <li><p>One of the coolest things I learned in this article, and will be what I showcase in the code sample
                    is a feature of the &lt;p&gt; tag. When writing paragraphs there may come a time where we want to use the
                    paragraph tag but have the next line carry over. At first, I was very confused on how to do this, I tried
                    inserting a lot of spaces, tabs, more p tags, but soon came to realize that this is simply not the way to do 
                    it. This is where the article taught me about &lt;br&gt;. with the &lt;br&gt; tag we can make a line continue
                    onto the next without trying to backdoor any html code or do some weird unreadable code method! Here is an example:

                </p></li>
            </ul>
            <li><h3>Sample Code</h3></li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>&lt;body&gt; <br>
                        <p>Top</p> &lt;br&gt; <br>
                        <p>Middle</p> &lt;br&gt; <br>
                        <p>Bottom</p> &lt;br&gt; <br>
                        &lt;/body&gt; <br>
                        As we can see with this example it creates a pyramid when we use the br tag!
