        <ul>
            <li><h3>Summary</h3></li>
            <ul>
                <li><p>I first wanted to start off with a basic article about everything simple on HTML.
                    I personally have never worked on anything HTML before, and I knew Geeks for Geeks is a 
                    great website to get started, so, here we are! The first thing that I found to be very important
                    were the body tags. In the Labs my partner and I had been getting away fine without them, but now I see
                    due to grouping of components as well as later on it's important when we get to complex topics, so that 
                    we as programmers can be aware of what is displaying on the page and what we do not want to display on the page.
                    The article did a great job, in all of it's code examples, with showing how to body tag should be used, and
                    more specifically why it should be used which I really appreciated. 
                </p></li>
                <li><p>One of the coolest things I learned in this article, and will be what I showcase in the code sample
                    is a feature of the &lt;p&gt; tag. When writing paragraphs there may come a time where we want to use the
                    paragraph tag but have the next line carry over. At first, I was very confused on how to do this, I tried
                    inserting a lot of spaces, tabs, more p tags, but soon came to realize that this is simply not the way to do 
                    it. This is where the article taught me about &lt;br&gt;. To quickly define the &lt;br&gt; tag
                    it allows us to be able to advance to the next line simply inside our current &lt;p&gt; tag. with the &lt;br&gt; tag we can 
                    make a line continue onto the next without trying to backdoor any html code or do some weird unreadable code method! 
                    Here is an example:

                </p></li>
            </ul>
            <li><h3>Sample Code</h3></li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>&lt;body&gt; <br>
                        Top &lt;br&gt; <br>
                        Middle&lt;br&gt; <br>
                        Bottom &lt;br&gt; <br>
                        &lt;/body&gt; <br>
                        As we can see with this example it creates a pyramid with top, middle, and bottom, when we use the br tag!

                </p></li>

        <h3>September 7, 2021</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Summary</h3></li>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Today I wanted to take a deep dive into a few CSS tricks. We've started to learn the basics of CSS in class
                    so I figured taking a swing at some articles that might have some nice tips would be a good way to position myself
                    to have a great opportunity to succeed. The first part that struck me from this article was when it started talking about
                    the * character followed by the selector we want. I absolutely love stars in SQL so seeing it here, working relatively the same
                    way is so cool to me, and I'm glad to have it if I want to influence all characters globally in a document if needed. We also, in class,
                    started talking about precedence and the 3rd trick it talks about is using "!mportant" I can see this coming in handy at some point. This is 
                    obviously something we would want to use sparingly as it can really mess up the order in which things should be running and being handled
                    but for sure will be something I use in a pinch.
                </p></li>
                <li><p>The topic that I want to talk about involves two points in the articles, the first is number 13 which is the :before selector and the second is 
                    number 10: Direct Children. These two things absolutely blew my mind and seem to be so handy in styling. For instance, I can see, with children elements
                    it getting very annoying to have to constantly go back and restyle every child element when you want it to look the same as a parent element, and having 
                    the ability to just make inheritance happen is so useful. The before selector is also very cool because we have the ability to slot whatever it may be before
                    a certain type of tag is used. This can be key, if for instance, you want to emphasize something important about an element or just want some unity between the 
                    beginnings of elements! lets take a look below at a few coding examples.
                </p></li>
            </ul>
            <li><h3>Sample Code</h3></li>
            <ul>
                <li><p>
                    Here is example code of the before tag being used to add the word "Read:" before every h2 tag and giving
                    it the color red.
                    <pre>h2:before { 
                        content: "Read: ";
                &lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;    color: #F00;&lt;/span&gt;
                    }</pre>
                </p></li>
                <li><p>
                    Here is example code of the direct children tag being used that will apply and style all 
                    active link elements under the footer tag.
                    <pre>#footer > a</pre>
                </p></li>
