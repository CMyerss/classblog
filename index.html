            <li><h3>Summary</h3></li>
            <ul>
                <li><p>I first wanted to start off with a basic article about everything simple on HTML.
                    I personally have never worked on anything HTML before, and I knew Geeks for Geeks is a 
                    great website to get started, so, here we are! The first thing that I found to be very important
                    were the body tags. In the Labs my partner and I had been getting away fine without them, but now I see
                    due to grouping of components as well as later on it's important when we get to complex topics, so that 
                    we as programmers can be aware of what is displaying on the page and what we do not want to display on the page.
                    The article did a great job, in all of it's code examples, with showing how to body tag should be used, and
                    more specifically why it should be used which I really appreciated. 
                </p></li>
                <li><p>One of the coolest things I learned in this article, and will be what I showcase in the code sample
                    is a feature of the &lt;p&gt; tag. When writing paragraphs there may come a time where we want to use the
                    paragraph tag but have the next line carry over. At first, I was very confused on how to do this, I tried
                    inserting a lot of spaces, tabs, more p tags, but soon came to realize that this is simply not the way to do 
                    it. This is where the article taught me about &lt;br&gt;. To quickly define the &lt;br&gt; tag
                    it allows us to be able to advance to the next line simply inside our current &lt;p&gt; tag. with the &lt;br&gt; tag we can 
                    make a line continue onto the next without trying to backdoor any html code or do some weird unreadable code method! 
                    Here is an example:

                </p></li>
            </ul>
            <li><h3>Sample Code</h3></li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>&lt;body&gt; <br>
                        Top &lt;br&gt; <br>
                        Middle&lt;br&gt; <br>
                        Bottom &lt;br&gt; <br>
                        &lt;/body&gt; <br>
                        As we can see with this example it creates a pyramid with top, middle, and bottom, when we use the br tag!
