        <h3>September 2, 2021</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Summary</h3></li>
            <ul>
                <li><p>I first wanted to start off with a basic article about everything simple on HTML.
                    I personally have never worked on anything HTML before, and I knew Geeks for Geeks is a 
                    great website to get started, so, here we are! The first thing that I found to be very important
                    were the body tags. In the Labs my partner and I had been getting away fine without them, but now I see
                    due to grouping of components as well as later on it's important when we get to complex topics, so that 
                    we as programmers can be aware of what is displaying on the page and what we do not want to display on the page.
                    The article did a great job, in all of it's code examples, with showing how to body tag should be used, and
                    more specifically why it should be used which I really appreciated. 
                </p></li>
                <li><p>One of the coolest things I learned in this article, and will be what I showcase in the code sample
                    is a feature of the &lt;p&gt; tag. When writing paragraphs there may come a time where we want to use the
                    paragraph tag but have the next line carry over. At first, I was very confused on how to do this, I tried
                    inserting a lot of spaces, tabs, more p tags, but soon came to realize that this is simply not the way to do 
                    it. This is where the article taught me about &lt;br&gt;. To quickly define the &lt;br&gt; tag
                    it allows us to be able to advance to the next line simply inside our current &lt;p&gt; tag. with the &lt;br&gt; tag we can 
                    make a line continue onto the next without trying to backdoor any html code or do some weird unreadable code method! 
                    Here is an example:

                </p></li>
            </ul>
            <li><h3>Sample Code</h3></li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>&lt;body&gt; <br>
                        Top &lt;br&gt; <br>
                        Middle&lt;br&gt; <br>
                        Bottom &lt;br&gt; <br>
                        &lt;/body&gt; <br>
                        As we can see with this example it creates a pyramid with top, middle, and bottom, when we use the br tag!

                </p></li>

        <h3>September 7, 2021</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Summary</h3></li>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Today I wanted to take a deep dive into a few CSS tricks. We've started to learn the basics of CSS in class
                    so I figured taking a swing at some articles that might have some nice tips would be a good way to position myself
                    to have a great opportunity to succeed. The first part that struck me from this article was when it started talking about
                    the * character followed by the selector we want. I absolutely love stars in SQL so seeing it here, working relatively the same
                    way is so cool to me, and I'm glad to have it if I want to influence all characters globally in a document if needed. We also, in class,
                    started talking about precedence and the 3rd trick it talks about is using "!mportant" I can see this coming in handy at some point. This is 
                    obviously something we would want to use sparingly as it can really mess up the order in which things should be running and being handled
                    but for sure will be something I use in a pinch.
                </p></li>
                <li><p>The topic that I want to talk about involves two points in the articles, the first is number 13 which is the :before selector and the second is 
                    number 10: Direct Children. These two things absolutely blew my mind and seem to be so handy in styling. For instance, I can see, with children elements
                    it getting very annoying to have to constantly go back and restyle every child element when you want it to look the same as a parent element, and having 
                    the ability to just make inheritance happen is so useful. The before selector is also very cool because we have the ability to slot whatever it may be before
                    a certain type of tag is used. This can be key, if for instance, you want to emphasize something important about an element or just want some unity between the 
                    beginnings of elements! lets take a look below at a few coding examples.
                </p></li>
            </ul>
            <li><h3>Sample Code</h3></li>
            <ul>
                <li><p>
                    Here is example code of the before tag being used to add the word "Read:" before every h2 tag and giving
                    it the color red.
                    <pre>h2:before { 
                        content: "Read: ";
                &lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;    color: #F00;&lt;/span&gt;
                    }</pre>
                </p></li>
                <li><p>
                    Here is example code of the direct children tag being used that will apply and style all 
                    active link elements under the footer tag.
                    <pre>#footer > a</pre>
                </p></li>

        <ul>
            <li><h3>Summary</h3></li>
            <ul>
                <li><p> As we continue to learn about CSS and HTML I wanted to continue my learning of neat CSS tricks. 
                    One of the very cool tricks I found which I can guarantee I am going to use in my P1 is curving text around
                    a floating image. I want to do my project on my volunteer fire department back home and I believe that a cool 
                    feature would be to place photos of calls or trucks along with the articles that we have would be a really good look
                    and a great idea. It is also very easy thing to code, I will show the sample code down below for a circle wrap. I also believe
                    that this technique is great for more than just my use case. People like to make boring things not boring so if text can do something
                    besides justs being a boring rectangle, then we are making, hopefully, more people want to read the article than we might have been able to
                    get to read it before. 
                </p></li>
                <li><p>The next piece on the page that peaked my interest was that you can make gradients with CSS. I can't imagine how crazy people went 
                    with this back in the day but I can guarantee that I'm going to go crazy with it for this project. Gradients are a fickle subject, they work 
                    really well in some places, but work horribly in others. I'll take the US Soccer teams jersey as an example a few years back. I hated it. They did
                    this weird play on the gradient where it was a gradient but wasn't at the same time? For example, towards the top they put white strips throughout the 
                    gradient and it just look horrendous. however, there are some teams who did a great job with gradients. I do not watch basketball but I have seen a ton 
                    of the Miami Heats gradient jerseys walking around and it looks absolutely gorgeous. They went with two opposing colors and made them blend beautifully and that 
                    is what I want to achieve with my website when I use the gradient (potentially) for the background. A code sample of how to achieve a gradient can be seen below.

                <li><p>
                    Here is the sample code for the wrapping of text around an image!
                    <pre>
                        .shape {
                            width: 300px;
                            float: left;
                            shape-outside: circle(50%);
                        }
                    </pre>
                </p></li>
                <li><p>
                    Here is the sample code for the gradient!
                    <pre>
                        body {
                           background: linear-gradient(to right, red, blue); 
                        }
                    </pre>

        <h3>September 24, 2021</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Summary</h3></li>
            <ul>
                <li><p> One of the requirements for the upcoming P1 is that we need to do some sort of animation using CSS or javascript. Being we have not used JavaScript yet, I wanted to see what animations can be done 
                    with using soley CSS! After, scavengering around the universe of the internet I came across this article and I want to discuss and look at some of the code I found pertaining to animations. First, I do want to
                    say that using animations can be very tacky with a very early understanding with code, so I am very happy to have found this because any animation I could have thought of doing would look a thousand times worse. 
                    It is also a little difficult for me to think of an animation to use, being my use-case for the project doesn't really have anything that I can imagine using in an animation? I orignially thought that it might be
                    cute to make a little firetruck drive across the page, and it may be something that I attempt to do, but it will take a good amount of time to figure out. Luckily, with this page, I have drawn a little bit of inspiration
                    and might start out with something much simpler.
                </p></li>
                <li><p> The code example I want to show today is an image accordian. I believe that this could be very useful, and surely interesting. With the fire department, an easy way to help people understand what you do is through photos! 
                    My thought process here would be that I could make this accordian with photos I accrue from our Facebook and use them in a way like this is to where someone can "play the accordian," or more realistically what they are doing,
                    click through the photos that appear in a very clean and organized design that makes it feel very interactive. I was thinking as well is I could put a link someone on the accordian as well with each of the images and attach them
                    to some page that will give a little explination to the image and what is going on so that they feel a little more relatable and as if the reader has the ability to "step-into" the photo.

            <ul>
                <li><p> If I were to be teaching this class, I think that I would overall keep it about the same. I am a fan of the flipped classroom style,
                    I think that it promotes learning and is important with a class like this that does not have enough breakdown to really allow the student to 
                    benefit from the style of normal classroom where a leacture could help. If we had more time, I would teach more on semantics and syntax of javascript 
                    and I would keep the labs as I believe it is very useful to actually do what is being taught in a small simulated environment. I would also keep the PAs 
                    and I liked being able to work with a partner, but I also understand that for some that may not be the most ideal situation so maybe have it up to people 
                    if they want to do that. For partners, I would advise to check in with like a form or something that their partner can't see to see if everyone is pulling their
                    weight. I know in the past this has been an issue in groups I've been in and being able to communicate that is nice. Very happy I didn't have that in this class.
                    I think what most helped me learn the material of this class was the book and the labs. Without those I don't think I would have been able to do any of the PAs. 
                    I would maybe recommend small reading quizzes not worth a bunch to hopefully encourage students to read as they have no idea how imperative it is they do it if they
                    want to have an ability to do the work in this class.
